	abstract = {The continuous ranked probability score (CRPS) is a much used measure of performance for probabilistic forecasts of a scalar observation. It is a quadratic measure of the difference between the forecast cumulative distribution function (CDF) and the empirical CDF of the observation. Analytic formulations of the CRPS can be derived for most classical parametric distributions, and be used to assess the efficiency of different CRPS estimators. When the true forecast CDF is not fully known, but represented as an ensemble of values, the CRPS is estimated with some error. Thus, using the CRPS to compare parametric probabilistic forecasts with ensemble forecasts may be misleading due to the unknown error of the estimated CRPS for the ensemble. With simulated data, the impact of the type of the verified ensemble (a random sample or a set of quantiles) on the CRPS estimation is studied. Based on these simulations, recommendations are issued to choose the most accurate CRPS estimator according to the type of ensemble. The interest of these recommendations is illustrated with real ensemble weather forecasts. Also, relationships between several estimators of the CRPS are demonstrated and used to explain the differences of accuracy between the estimators.},
